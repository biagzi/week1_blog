I am a first year graduate student in Psychology at Princeton University.

I am originally from Brazil, where I completed my undergrad in Physics and Masters in Bioinformatic. I love to share and discuss science, mostly quantitative methods to tackle interdisciplinary problems in evolution, development, and animal behavior.

Feel free to contact me :)
